This repository is a result of the ALFFA project
http://alffa.imag.fr

We distribute READY-to-use (or READY-to-train) KALDI ASR systems and (when possible) associated corpora....

A summary of these resources and ASR performacnes, as well as the project will be published soon in the following paper:
Collecting Resources in Sub-Saharan African Languages for Automatic Speech Recognition: a Case Study of Wolof. Elodie Gauthier, Laurent Besacier, Sylvie Voisin, Michael Melese and Uriel Pascal Elingui. To appear at LREC 2016

So far, the ASR directory contains Kaldi recipes for 3 languages : Amharic, Swahili and Hausa (Wolof will follow soon, stay tuned !).

================AMHARIC=======================================

In ASR/AMHARIC/ you will find kaldi recipes + ressources - see README file for more details and ASR performance results that you should be able to reproduce - please cite this paper if you publish work using theses resources

In the CORPUS.old directory, you can find the corpus collected for Swahili but this directory is obsolete since you can find everything in each ASR sub-directory
