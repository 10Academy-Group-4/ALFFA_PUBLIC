ALFFA_PUBLIC
============

This repository is a result of the ALFFA project
http://alffa.imag.fr

We distribute READY-to-use (or READY-to-train) KALDI ASR systems and (when possible) associated corpora....

So far, the ASR directory contains Kaldi recipes for 3 languages : Amharic, Swahili and Hausa (Wolof will follow soon, stay tuned !).


In the CORPUS.old directory, you can find the corpus collected for Swahili but this dorectory is obsolete since you can find everything in each ASR sub-directory
